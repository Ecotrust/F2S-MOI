For each of these Sectors, there are identified Priority Outcomes, short- and long-term changes or benefits that result from farm to school activities. Each outcome has an associated set of Indicators that reflect how a system is working and can help to understand causes of problems as well as ways to address them.

For each of these Sectors, there are identified Priority Outcomes, short- and long-term changes or benefits that result from farm to school activities. Each outcome has an associated set of Indicators that reflect how a system is working and can help to understand causes of problems as well as ways to address them.
