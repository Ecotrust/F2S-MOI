The state of\\\\nOregon also collects data from all recipients of its farm to school and school\\\\ngarden grant program. The data collected on these districts is fairly\\\\ncomprehensive and includes total dollars spent on local products, number of\\\\neducational activities conducted, and more. Data available from other sources\\\\nhelps to fill in holes in the census and state grant data.

Farm to School and School Garden Network (OFSSGN) is a group of\\nmore than 900 stakeholders across the state who are making these changes happen\\nevery day. This website is where we track our progress and measure our success\\nat putting more money in the pockets of Oregon's farmers, teaching students\\nabout farm fresh foods, increasing access to local healthy foods in schools and\\npreschools, and stewarding the land for future generations.<br/></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p><br/></p><h2>Evaluation is needed for transformation</h2><p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOregon's farm to school movement cannot set\\ngoals or measure progress without data to show us where we're at. In 2013 the\\nOFSSGN set to work identifying priorities and available data at a statewide\\nlevel to measure the impact of our work. We were fortunate that a framework for\\nevaluating the impact of farm to school, informed by multiple stakeholders and\\nvetted by experts, was soon to be published by the\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://www.farmtoschool.org/\\\">National Farm to School Network</a>\\u00a0 (view the full framework\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://www.farmtoschool.org/resources-main/evaluation-framework\\\">here</a>). We used this framework to inform our own efforts\\nto measure and categorize our success. We were also fortunate that the\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://farmtoschoolcensus.fns.usda.gov/\\\">USDA Farm to School Census</a>\\u00a0had started to\\nprovide data for many aspects of farm to school in Oregon, and Oregon partners\\nhad begun collecting data via Oregon's farm to school and school garden grant\\nprogram.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Oregon's farm to school data.</h2><p>The USDA Farm\\nto School Census provides one source of data for topics such as how districts\\ndefine local, the amount of dollars invested in local foods, and types of local\\nfoods purchased, for many Oregon school districts. First launched in the\\n2011-12 school year and repeated every two years, the census provides a\\nreliable snapshot of many aspects of farm to school in Oregon. The state of\\nOregon also collects data from all recipients of its farm to school and school\\ngarden grant program. The data collected on these districts is fairly\\ncomprehensive and includes total dollars spent on local products, number of\\neducational activities conducted, and more. Data available from other sources\\nhelps to fill in holes in the census and state grant data. For example, the\\nOregon Department of Education tracks the number of school gardens at every\\nsingle school in the state.</p><p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\"}}, {\"type\": \"basic_content\", \"value\": {\"content\": \"<h2>Oregon's evaluation framework</h2><p><embed alt=\\\"about_evaluation_framework.png\\\" embedtype=\\\"image\\\" format=\\\"center\\\" id=\\\"38\\\"/><br/></p><p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn line with the National Farm to School\\nNetwork\\u2019s evaluation framework, Oregon's data is categorized into four broad\\nsectors with the potential to influence outcomes for farm to school:\\u00a0<a id=\\\"46\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Community Economic Development</a>,\\u00a0<a id=\\\"47\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Education</a>,\\u00a0<a id=\\\"48\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Public Health</a>, and\\u00a0<a id=\\\"49\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Environmental Quality</a>.\\u00a0For each of these <b>Sectors</b>, there are identified Priority\\nOutcomes, which are the short- and long-term changes or benefits that\\nresult from farm to school activities.
